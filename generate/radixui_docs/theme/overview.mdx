# Theme overview

<Description>
  Use the Theme component to change the look and feel of your UI.
</Description>

## Anatomy

The Theme component defines the overall visual look of your application. It can be customized by passing a minimal set of configuration options.

```jsx live=true
<Theme
  accentColor="mint"
  grayColor="gray"
  panelBackground="solid"
  scaling="100%"
  radius="full"
>
  <ThemesVolumeControlExample />
</Theme>
```

A well tuned set of defaults is provided to get you started, but donâ€™t be afraid to play with all of the available options to find the right visual style for your application. Check out the Playground to see what effect each option has.

## Variants

Variants are visual variations of a component which are used to create visual hierarchies and communicate relative importance.

Each component offers a different set of variants, though all are designed to be consistent and complimentary with each other.

```jsx live=true
<Flex gap="3" align="center">
  <Button variant="classic">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="solid">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
  <Button variant="soft">
    Get started <ArrowRightIcon />
  </Button>
</Flex>
```

## Examples

Using a combination of component variants alongside customized theme settings allows you to create a multitude of unique-looking interfaces.

For example you could create:

- Music applications
- Ecommerce product elements
- SaaS dashboards

Or any number of differing treatments and styles.
