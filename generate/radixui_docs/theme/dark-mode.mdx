# Dark mode

<Description>Using appearance to manage and integrate dark mode.</Description>

## Overview

Light and dark modes are supported out of the box, allowing you to easily switch appearance without additional design or styling.

<Box my="5">
  <ThemesDarkModeExample />
</Box>

## Basic usage

By default, the root `Theme` appearance is `light`. To set a different appearance pass it via the `appearance` prop. This will force the theme to use the specified setting.

```jsx line=1
<Theme appearance="dark">
  <MyApp />
</Theme>
```

## Inheriting system appearance

A common requirement is to inherit the appearance setting from a user’s system preferences.

This is a deceptively complex problem to solve given SSR, SSG and client side hydration considerations. To make implementation easier, we recommend integrating with a theme switching library.

### With next-themes

Integration with `next-themes` is simple and straightforward because Radix Themes implements matching class names.

To enable dark mode, use `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes` with `attribute="class"`.

```jsx line=6
import { Theme } from '@radix-ui/themes';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'next-themes';

export default function () {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class">
      <Theme>
        <MyApp />
      </Theme>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

{

<Callout.Root my="5" color="gray">
  <Callout.Icon>
    <InfoCircledIcon />
  </Callout.Icon>
  <Callout.Text>
    <Strong>Do not</Strong> try to set{' '}
    <Code>{'<Theme appearance={resolvedTheme}>'}</Code>. Instead, rely just on
    class switching that <Code>next-themes</Code> provides. This way{' '}
    <Code>next-themes</Code> can prevent the appearance flash during initial
    render.
  </Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

}

### With other libraries

Any library that supports class switching is compatible. You’ll just need to ensure that the appended class names match those supported by Radix Themes:

- `className="light"`
- `className="light-theme"`
- `className="dark"`
- `className="dark-theme"`
