```jsx live="true"
<Spinner />
```

## API Reference

This component is based on the `span` element and supports common margin props.

| Prop | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| size | Responsive<"1" | "2" | "3"> | "2" |
| loading | boolean | true |


## Examples

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control the size of the spinner.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex align="center" gap="4">
  <Spinner size="1" />
  <Spinner size="2" />
  <Spinner size="3" />
</Flex>
```

### With children

Use the `loading` prop to control whether the spinner or its children are displayed. Spinner preserves the dimensions of children when they are hidden and disables interactive elements.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex gap="4">
  <Spinner loading={true}>
    <Switch defaultChecked />
  </Spinner>

  <Spinner loading={false}>
    <Switch defaultChecked />
  </Spinner>
</Flex>
```

### With buttons

Buttons have their own `loading` prop that automatically composes a spinner.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button loading>Bookmark</Button>
```

If you have an icon inside the button, you can use the button’s `disabled` state and wrap the icon in a standalone `<Spinner>` to achieve a more sophisticated design.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Button disabled>
  <Spinner loading>
    <BookmarkIcon />
  </Spinner>
  Bookmark
</Button>
```
