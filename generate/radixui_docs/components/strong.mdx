## API Reference

This component is based on the `strong` element and supports common marginÂ props.

| Prop | Type | Default |

| asChild | boolean |  |
| truncate | boolean |  |
| wrap | Responsive<"wrap" | "nowrap" | "pretty" | "balance"> |  |


## Examples

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
  <Strong truncate>
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Strong>
</Flex>
```
