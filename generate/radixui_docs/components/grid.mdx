## Examples

### Columns

The `columns` prop can also accept an object to create responsive layouts.

This example will create a grid with 1 column on smaller screens and 2 columns from the medium breakpoint.

```jsx live=true
<Grid columns={{ initial: '1', md: '2' }} gap="3" width="auto">
  <Box height="64px">
    <DecorativeBox />
  </Box>
  <Box height="64px">
    <DecorativeBox />
  </Box>
</Grid>
```
