## Examples

### As another element

Use the `as` prop to render text as a `p`, `label`, `div` or `span`. This prop is purely semantic and does not alter visual appearance.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p">This is a <Strong>paragraph</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="label">This is a <Strong>label</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="div">This is a <Strong>div</Strong> element.</Text>
<Text as="span">This is a <Strong>span</Strong> element.</Text>
```

### Size

Use the `size` prop to control text size. This prop also provides correct line height and corrective letter spacing—as text size increases, the relative line height and letter spacing decrease.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <Text size="1">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="2">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="3">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="4">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="5">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="6">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="7">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="8">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text size="9">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

Sizes 2–4 are designed to work well for long-form content.

```jsx live=true
<Text as="p" mb="5" size="4">
  The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and more pleasant. The question is: What proportion(s) will give us the best results? The golden ratio is often observed in nature where beauty and utility intersect; perhaps we can use this “divine” proportion to enhance these attributes in our typography.

Sizes 1–3 are designed to work well for UI labels.

```jsx live=true
<Grid align="center" columns="2" gap="5" p="3">
  <Flex direction="column">
    <Text size="3" weight="bold">
      Get started
    </Text>
    <Text color="gray" size="2">
      Start your next project in minutes
    </Text>
  </Flex>

  <Flex direction="column">
    <Text size="2" weight="bold">
      Get started
    </Text>
    <Text color="gray" size="2">
      Start your next project in minutes
    </Text>
  </Flex>

  <Flex direction="column">
    <Text size="2" weight="bold">
      Get started
    </Text>
    <Text color="gray" size="1">
      Start your next project in minutes
    </Text>
  </Flex>

  <Flex direction="column">
    <Text size="1" weight="bold">
      Get started
    </Text>
    <Text color="gray" size="1">
      Start your next project in minutes
    </Text>
  </Flex>
</Grid>
```

### Weight

Use the `weight` prop to set the text weight.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Text weight="regular" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="medium" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>

<Text weight="bold" as="div">
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
</Text>
```

### Align

Use the `align` prop to set text alignment.

```jsx live=true
<Text align="left" as="div">Left-aligned</Text>
<Text align="center" as="div">Center-aligned</Text>
<Text align="right" as="div">Right-aligned</Text>
```

### Trim

Use the `trim` prop to trim the leading space at the start, end, or both sides of the text box.

The prop works similarly to the upcoming half-leading control spec, but uses a common negative margin workaround under the hood for cross-browser support.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <Text
    trim="normal"
    style={{
      background: 'var(--gray-a2)',
      borderTop: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
      borderBottom: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
    }}
  >
    Without trim
  </Text>
  <Text
    trim="both"
    style={{
      background: 'var(--gray-a2)',
      borderTop: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
      borderBottom: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
    }}
  >
    With trim
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

Trimming the leading is useful when dialing in vertical spacing in cards or other “boxy” components. Otherwise, padding looks larger on top and bottom than on the sides.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column" gap="3">
  <Box
    style={{
      background: 'var(--gray-a2)',
      border: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
    }}
    p="4"
  >
    <Heading mb="1" size="3">
      Without trim
    </Heading>
    <Text>
      The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
      in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
      more pleasant.
    </Text>
  </Box>

  <Box
    p="4"
    style={{
      background: 'var(--gray-a2)',
      border: '1px dashed var(--gray-a7)',
    }}
  >
    <Heading mb="1" size="3" trim="start">
      With trim
    </Heading>
    <Text trim="end">
      The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
      in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
      more pleasant.
    </Text>
  </Box>
</Flex>
```

The default trim values are configured for the system font stack that’s used by Radix Themes. If you are using custom fonts, you can adjust the trim values using the corresponding CSS variables.

```css
.radix-themes {
  --default-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
  --default-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
  --heading-leading-trim-start: 0.42em;
  --heading-leading-trim-end: 0.36em;
}
```

### Truncate

Use the `truncate` prop to truncate text with an ellipsis when it overflows its container.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="300px">
  <Text truncate>
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

### Wrap

Use the `wrap` prop to control text wrapping.

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
  <Text wrap="nowrap">
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
  <Text wrap="balance">
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

```jsx live=true line=2
<Flex maxWidth="270px">
  <Text wrap="pretty">
    The goal of typography is to relate font size, line height, and line width
    in a proportional way that maximizes beauty and makes reading easier and
    more pleasant.
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

{

<Callout.Root my="5" color="gray">
  <Callout.Icon>
    <InfoCircledIcon />
  </Callout.Icon>
  <Callout.Text>
    <Code>text-wrap: pretty</Code> is an experimental value that is{' '}
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap#browser_compatibility">
      not yet supported in all browsers
    </a>
    . However, it can be treated as a progressive enhancement for browsers that do
    support it.
  </Callout.Text>
</Callout.Root>

}

### Color

Use the `color` prop to assign a specific color. The text colors are designed to achieve at least Lc 60 APCA contrast over common background colors.

```jsx live=true scroll=true
<Flex direction="column">
  <Text color="indigo">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text color="cyan">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text color="orange">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text color="crimson">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
</Flex>
```

### High-contrast

Use the `highContrast` prop to increase color contrast with the background.

```jsx live="true"
<Flex direction="column">
  <Text color="gray">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</Text>
  <Text color="gray" highContrast>
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
  </Text>
</Flex>
```

### With formatting

Compose `Text` with formatting components to add emphasis and structure to content.

```jsx live="true"
<Text as="p">
  Look, such a helpful <Link href="#">link</Link>, an <Em>italic emphasis</Em>,
  a piece of computer <Code>code</Code>, and even a hotkey combination{' '}
  <Kbd>⇧⌘A</Kbd> within the text.
</Text>
```

### With form controls

Composing `Text` with a form control like `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, or `Switch` automatically centers the control with the first line of text, even when the text is multi-line.

```jsx live="true"
<Box maxWidth="300px">
  <Text as="label" size="3">
    <Flex gap="2">
      <Checkbox defaultChecked /> I understand that these documents are
      confidential and cannot be shared with a third party.
    </Flex>
  </Text>
</Box>
```
