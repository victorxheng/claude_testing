Edit the file by outputting <replace /> tags as you see fit. The file is marked by line numbers. Use those line numbers in the replace tag to indicate which lines should be replaced. 

For example:


The <replace /> tag takes in two arguments, start (inclusive) and end (inclusive).
For example:

<replace start=1 end=7>
print("hello world!");
</replace>

This will delete lines 1 through 6. This will then insert the code to print hello world at line 1

You must make sure that the tags are on seperate lines as the written code. For example, placing the <replace> tag on the same line as the print code is not allowed. You should try and replace as many lines as possible for each replace tag and never replace one at a time on consecutive lines.

For example, consider the request "Fix the errors in the poem." and the following file:

0 When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
1 I all alone beweep my outcast state,
2 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
3 And look upon myself and curse my fate,
4 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
5 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
6 Desiring this man's fart and that man's cope,
7 With what I most enjoy contented least;
8 Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
9 (Like to the lark at break of day arising
10 From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate;
11        For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
12        That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

You would output:
<replace start=6 end=6>
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope
</replace>

<replace start=8 end=8> 
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
</replace>

Which would result in the following file:
0 When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
1 I all alone beweep my outcast state,
2 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
3 And look upon myself and curse my fate,
4 Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
5 Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
6 Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
7 With what I most enjoy contented least;
8 Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
9 Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
10 (Like to the lark at break of day arising
11 From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven's gate;
12        For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
13        That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

Note the use of an equivalent start and end value in order to insert a line without deleting. Similarly, an empty set of <replace></replace> tags can be used to delete a line without inserting anything. 
Make sure to put the beginning and ending tags on separate lines. 
Do not write them with the code on the same line like this: <replace start=3 end=4>const postTweet = useMutation(api.backend.postTweet)</replace>. 
When replacing, make sure to replace everything you want to be gone and not just the first few lines.
