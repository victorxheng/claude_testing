Generate YCâ€™s Co-founder Matching website. It allows entrepreneurs to create a profile, and find the contact information of other entrepreneurs.
It should feature the following pages:
1. A home landing page advertising the Co-founder matching site, which allows the user to start creating an account using the built-in clerk authentication buttons, and shows marketing items advertising how many prestigious Stanford/MIT cofounders are on here. 
2. Next, after the user creates an account by entering their email, they are taken to a page where they create their own profile. They fill out their profile information, which includes the following: their name, a one liner on their background, a link to a linkedin profile (which is hidden from others until matched), and a checkbox on if they are a technical cofounder or not.
3. After their profile is created, they then can view other profiles and interact with them on the match page. Here, they scroll through a list of other user profiles who do not have a match yet. If they are interested, they can press a match button that sends them a match request as well as a short message.
4. Users can also view their match requests, and either approve or reject them. If a request is rejected, it is removed from the matches. If they approve, the request gets moved to a match section, where they can add the other person on linkedin using their linkedin link.
5. Users can also edit their profile as well. If they found a cofounder, they can mark their profile as matched, and they will be removed from the search.

Schema:
User: email, name, linkedin, description, technical / non technical, available / not available
Match: User from, User to, Accepted / rejected, request message, accept message
